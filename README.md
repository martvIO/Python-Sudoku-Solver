# üß© Sudoku Solver Visualization

## üåü Overview
This project is a **Sudoku Solver Visualization** built using Python and Pygame. It showcases how a Sudoku puzzle is solved step-by-step, visually highlighting the progress. The project is modular, with each component separated into logical files for better maintainability and readability.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. **Main Script (`main.py`)**
- üèÅ This is the entry point of the application.
- Initializes the Sudoku board and starts the visualization loop.
- Handles user input such as quitting the program.

### 2. **Constants (`constants.py`)**
- üìã Contains global constants such as:
  - üßÆ Grid size, cell size, and padding.
  - üé® Color definitions for the UI (e.g., `WHITE`, `GRAY`, etc.).

### 3. **Visualization (`visualization.py`)**
- üñºÔ∏è Manages Pygame initialization and drawing of the grid.
- Handles the visual representation of the Sudoku board, including:
  - üî¢ Number placement.
  - ‚ú® Highlighting cells during the solving process.
  - üìè Drawing the grid lines.

### 4. **Board Handling (`board.py`)**
- üßÆ Contains helper functions for board setup and manipulation:
  - `string_to_board(sudoku_string)`: Converts a string representation of the Sudoku puzzle into a 2D list.

### 5. **Solver (`solver.py`)**
- ü§ñ Implements the logic to solve the Sudoku puzzle using:
  - **Backtracking Algorithm**: A recursive method to try numbers in empty cells while ensuring validity.
  - **Validation Function**: Ensures a number can be placed in a specific cell based on Sudoku rules.
- Calls visualization functions to update the grid in real-time as it solves the puzzle.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Install
1. Ensure you have Python (>=3.7) installed on your system.
2. Install Pygame by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Clone or download the project files to your local system.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sudoku_solver
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üìå Where to Define the Sudoku Puzzle
- The Sudoku puzzle you want to solve is defined as a string in `main.py`:
  ```python
  sudoku_string = "070000300040053900900008000006000004300049000005000060000100200050000700000070051"
  ```
- Replace the `sudoku_string` with your own puzzle string. The string must contain exactly 81 characters where:
  - Digits `1-9` represent pre-filled cells.
  - `0` represents empty cells.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Watch the Sudoku puzzle being solved step-by-step.
- **Customizable**: Update the Sudoku string in `main.py` to solve different puzzles.
- **User Interaction**:
  - üõë Press `ESC` to quit the program.
  - üöÄ Automatically starts solving upon launch.

---

## üîç Example
The default Sudoku puzzle is defined in `main.py` as:
```python
sudoku_string = "070000300040053900900008000006000004300049000005000060000100200050000700000070051"
```
You can replace this string with any valid Sudoku puzzle (81 characters, 0 for empty cells).
